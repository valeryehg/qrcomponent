## Overview
I *just* started learning HTML + CSS in the last week on freeCodeCamp, which is an excellent resource but I needed to practice *outside* of guided projects because I realized I didn't really understand things on my own if there weren't instructions. Don't get me wrong, I love freeCodeCamp's abundant resources but I do need to practice using various resources.


This is where Frontend Mentor enters the picture. I used HTML and CSS to create a QR code component as closely to the example image as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
I learned more about CSS boxes, alignment, and positioning. To figure this out, I watched a YouTube video that I linked in the resources section. I learned that I need a lot more practice and patience, but it was nice to see it coming together. Simple, yes but still something I feel good about since progress is progress! I learned more about styling and the role of ids and classes in CSS.



### Continued development

I want to continue working on my understanding of boxes and positioning, and 'simpler' ways of doing things. Something that was a little hard for me to grasp was the fact that margins can be eaten up so I want to work on my understanding of that. I want to continue with frontend mentor challenges and slowly increasing the complexity of my HTML and CSS! The biggest area of improvement that I need is in CSS, I believe.


### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Positioning Quickly With A Real World Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxEtxo_AaZ4&ab_channel=SlayingTheDragon) - This YouTube video helped me begin to understand the CSS box model, I was really struggling with centering elements and moving them into the positions I wanted prior to watching this!
- [Titles, Subtitles And Paragraphs: HTML H1 Tags And P](https://nestify.io/blog/titles-subtitles-paragraphs-html-h1-tags-p/) - This article does a good job at explaining different tags and their use cases. I was unsure of whether to make the text in the QR card < p > or < h1 > and didn't know if it would fundamentally shift the way I used CSS and this article helped clarify that.
- [How to Import Google Fonts in CSS File](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-import-google-fonts-in-css-file.html) - This article quickly explains how to add Google Fonts to your projects with examples. It helped me correct an error in which I included the link in the main HTML and CSS but still couldn't get the text to appear in the fonts needed. 
- [Responsive website: How to get rid of horizontal scroll bar?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18645870/responsive-website-how-to-get-rid-of-horizontal-scroll-bar) - I used this article to figure out how to hide the horizontal scroll bar, prior to reading it I was trying to add overflow-x:hidden to each element individually.
